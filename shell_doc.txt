Interprocess communication

->In parent process we create a pipe using system call PIPE(fd[2])

->in child1 we execute processes that is left of pipe. this process will
 be the writer process. Therefore in child1 we close the read end of pipe
 i.e fd[0] and close stdout i.e 1. make fd[1] duplicate file descriptor
 to stdout and then exec the corresponding program.

->in child2 we execite processes that is to the right of pipe. this
  process will be the reader process. therefore in child2 we close the
  write end of the pipe i.e fd[1] and close stdin i.e 0. make fd[0]
  duplicate file descriptod to stdin and hen exec the corresponding
  program

->how do we know which program will be the writer and which program will
  be the reader?
  we keep count of the child processes created. and decide it as follows
  if(child_count % 2)
    reader process
  else
    writer process

->finally, after all the processes have been executed, the output will be
  in the pipe. therefore to print the output, close the write end of pipe
  in parent and output from the read end of the pipe.
